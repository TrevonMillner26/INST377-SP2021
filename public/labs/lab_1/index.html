    <h1>Trevon Millner's Lab 1</h1>
    <p>First, we need to learn the basics</p>

    <h2>Headings</h2>
    <p>Headings define the outline of your site. There are six levels of headings.</p>

    <h2>Lists</h2>

    <p>How to make an unordered list:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>HTML/CSS underpins most user interfaces now.</li>
        <li>CSS tries something so hard no other computer language even bothers.</li>
        <li>Javascript got popular by having a runtime in every browser in the world.</li>
</ul>

<p>And now, an ordered list of my top 5 albums:</p>

<ol><li>DAMN -Kendrick Lamar(2017)</li>
    <li>Bandana -Freddie Gibbs(2019)</li>
    <li>Dummy -Portishead(1994)</li>
    <li>Reasonable Doubt -Jay-Z(1996)</li>
    <li>IV -BADBADNOTGOOD(2016)</li>
</ol>

<h2>Inline Elements</h2>

I just wanted to <em>draw attention</em> to some of the <em>phrases</em> in this sentece. That's all.

<p>This time, I wanted to <strong>strongly emphasize</strong> what I was saying in this sentence.</p>

<p><em><strong>And I can also do both!!</strong></em></p>

<h2>Empty Elements</h2>

<p>Soft line breaks cannot wrap anything.
    Thanks for reading, I hope this helps!

<p>P.S. This is my first time trying something like this, so it may look messy. I'll get better throughout
    the semester.</p>
