    <h1>Trevon Millner's Lab 1</h1>
    <p>First, we need to learn the basics</p>

    <h2>Headings</h2>
    <p>Headings define the outline of your site. There are six levels of headings.</p>

    <h2>Lists</h2>

    <p>How to make an unordered list:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>HTML/CSS underpins most user interfaces now.</li>
        <li>CSS tries something so hard no other computer language even bothers.</li>
        <li>Javascript got popular by having a runtime in every browser in the world.</li>
</ul>

<p>And now, an ordered list of my top 5 albums:</p>

<ol><li>DAMN -Kendrick Lamar(2017)</li>
    <li>Bandana -Freddie Gibbs(2019)</li>
    <li>Dummy -Portishead(1994)</li>
    <li>Reasonable Doubt -Jay-Z(1996)</li>
    <li>IV -BADBADNOTGOOD(2016)</li>
</ol>

<h2>Inline Elements</h2>

I just wanted to <em>draw attention</em> to some of the <em>phrases</em> in this sentece. That's all.

<p>This time, I wanted to <strong>strongly emphasize</strong> what I was saying in this sentence.</p>

<p><em><strong>And I can also do both!!</strong></em></p>

<h2>Empty Elements</h2>

<p>Soft line breaks cannot wrap anything.
    Thanks for reading, I hope this helps!

<p>P.S. This is my first time trying something like this, so it may look messy. I'll get better throughout
    the semester.</p>

First, the basics.

Alex Heading 1

Headings set your default page size

Add your four mochi images from your tutorial here. 

Lists

Let's make an unordered list.

Add an unordered list element
nest each item inside the unordered list in a list tag
List elements can be in any order

And now, one in order.

Add an ordered list element.
Add your top five music albums in order to the list.
Check it out, numbers by default.

Inline elements

Sometimes you want to draw attention to something in a line of text.

Sometimes you want to strongly emphasize something in the text.

Sometimes you want to do both.

Empty Elements

Soft line breaks can't wrap anything. Neither can image tags, or hard lines.

Add a hard line under here.

This page probably doesn't look great - we'll learn how to hook it to CSS next week.
